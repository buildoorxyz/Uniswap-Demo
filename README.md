# DEMO - Uniswap Immersive Experience 

This POC / Demo is to showcase how immersive experience works as a guiding layer for users to navigate within the application. 

At the end of every experience, user earns some incentives in form of tokens, NFTs, or XPs 

It will be further backed by powerful analytics to track User behavior and journey based on wallets. 

## Accessing the Immersive Experience

Currently, user must connect a web3 wallet in order to proceed further with the immersive experience. 

Skip button is not functional because it doesn't serve the purpose of layovers POC at this point. It will be functional in the main product / MVP.  


- ### Wallet Profile

A wallet profile is automatically created when the wallet is linked with Uniswap. It can be accessed from the bottom left side of the screen by clicking on Buildoor logo.

It displays max number of XPs, token bounty, NFTs that can be claimed by completing any immersive experience. 

Furthermore, XP gained by wallet and its calculation is also shown below it. 

- ### Milestones

Milestones track all the activity that needs to be done by the user. Once the activity is completed a check mark is displayed besides the milestone. 

Once the whole experience is completed, a flag appears on the last milestone. 

- ### Activity

Activity tab displays available tasks / activities like daily login, engaging with a particular feature, etc. 

- ### Help

Help section contains FAQs to help users gain a better understanding of the product. 

# Technical Roadmap and Integrations

Layovers POC is completed, now there are following major developments in pipeline. 

### Notifications with Push Protocol 

Notifications will be delivered to all the users whenever a new immerisve experience or activity like daily login, feature engagement is available to explore.  

### Privacy focused Wallet based User Journey Analytics

We plan to track user journey analytics based on connected wallet. It is a combination of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) focused traditional analytics + on-chain analytics. 

Major difference here is - Buildoor will never track user IP address. We will always map user activity with their wallet. 

### Filecoin Storage Integration to store Analytics Data

User-journey analytics will be stored in file-coin storage. Dapps / products will be able to access it directly in a dashboard.

### Dashboard Development 

Analytics dashboard will contain all the insights recorded dusring user journey. It will help products / dapps understand user behaviour and optimize immersive experience to simplify their product.
